<h2>What is Crazy Time?</h2>

Crazy Time is an interactive, fast-paced live game show hosted by real dealers in a virtual casino environment.

Along with standard betting options, Crazy Time features four unique bonus rounds that provide even more chances to win big: Coin Flip, Pachinko, Cash Hunt, and Crazy Time.

Each spin of the wheel not only offers potential payouts but also the chance to enter these bonus rounds, where multipliers can significantly increase your winnings.

<h2>How Crazy Time Works</h2>
At the core of the Crazy Time game is a large, colorful wheel divided into 54 segments, each representing different multipliers and bonus games. 
Players place bets on various outcomes, including numbers or one of the four exciting bonus games:

<ul>
 <li>Cash Hunt </li>
 <li>Coin Flip</li>
 <li>Pachinko</li>
 <li>Crazy Time </li>
</ul>
The wheel is spun, and if the outcome matches the player's bet, they win based on the odds of that result.
